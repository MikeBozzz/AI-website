                    Some of his most famous feats include graduating from one of the most renowned universities in
                    England, King’s College, Cambridge, then proceeding with the obtaining of a PhD from the Department
                    of Mathematics at Princeton University.

                        After that he became a professor and during World War 2 worked at the Government Code and Cypher
                        School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park as the head of a team of men with the job of cracking Enigma,
                        the incredibly-difficult-to-decrypt code the Germans used to communicate in secrecy.
                    </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    What will become known as one of the greatest feats in history, he managed to crack the code with
                    the use of an amazing digital computer that figured out the settings of the encryption machine
                    Enigma in a matter of months.
                    I highly suggest to watch the movie “The Imitation Game” to have a romanticized tell of the tale of
                    the defeat of Enigma, it’s a really good movie.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    What we’re concentrating more on though is his accomplishments after the war, such as the design of
                    the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first design for a stored-program computer, and his
                    contribution in the development of the Manchester Computers.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    While working on the Manchester Mark 1, Turing wrote the first version of the Programmer's Manual
                    for this machine, and was recruited by Ferranti as a consultant in the development of their
                    commercialised machine, the Ferranti Mark 1.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    During this time, he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics, and in “Computing Machinery
                    and Intelligence, Turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence, and proposed an
                    experiment that became known as the Turing Test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be
                    called "intelligent". The idea was that a computer could be said to "think" if a human interrogator
                    could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being. <br>
                    The Turing Test is what we could call “a test to recognize the mind behind a conversation”, in order
                    to assess if during this test we’d be talking to a computer or a human, by asking question and see
                    what the answer is.
                </p>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    Also, in the paper, Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind,
                    it would be better to produce a simpler one to simulate a child's mind and then to subject it to a
                    course of education. This will become the base for AI development and machine learning, arriving all
                    the way to nowadays where we have AIs that no longer complete tasks by observing millions of
                    previous cases, but also complete tasks by analyzing the problem and “learning” how to solve it
                    through data interpretation and logical deduction.
                </p>


                <p class="paragraph">
                    Despite these accomplishments, Turing was never fully recognized in Britain during his lifetime
                    because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act. Luckily all the recognition would
                    arrive post-mortem, with the culmination of it in what is knows as the Nobel Prize for informatics:
                    the Turing Award, an annual award for computer science innovations.
