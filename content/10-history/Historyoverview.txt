              Pictures

 10-(picturename).(someformat)  
 
 Maybe it would be better to name something like this:
 
   10-(your history period)(1 or 2 or 3).(someformat) -->>  10-1970-1990(1).jpg ;  
          and if you have two, three pictures    -->> 10-1970-1990(2).jpg 
          
          
 
 
 
  You can start doing your html pages
  (do not make  other folder, just add your html file to the history folder and your pictures to the picture folder)
  
  
  
  
  
  Pages must be finish by Tueday afternoon
